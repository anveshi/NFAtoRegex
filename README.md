This program reads an NFA from a text file, formatted properly, and eliminates
states to form a regex representing the entire thing.

I was using Python 3.X. As of 3.0, print became a function (so print("My string")) 
and raw_input() became input(). If you're running Python 2.X, it won't compile. Edit
those functions accordingly.

Two test cases are included in this repo.
